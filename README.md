## Background

Recently I've been working on some Meraki deployments involving hundreds of AP's, 30 or so security gateways and around 50 switches.

To speed up the process, I created some basic scripts to automate various parts of the process using the API.
Some of these scripts will prompt for variables (switch name, config, API key etc) while others may not be as polished.
